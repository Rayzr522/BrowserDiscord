A custom 100% serverless Discord client. Just give it your bot token and you're good to go.

### You want my bot token!?
Nope. I don't, but the script does. The great thing about this, is you're _not trusting me with anything._ The webpage is 100% client-side, meaning there is no server that is maliciously logging all your keystrokes. Everything is contained within *your* browser.
